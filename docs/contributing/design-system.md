description: The tokens, the styleguide and the rules for the markup of the Loupe app.

The design system is the set of values and building blocks that give every page of the app one look. The tokens are values. The components are building blocks made of those values.

## The styleguide

Run the app in dev and open `/styleguide`. The page draws every token group and every catalog entry from the real stylesheet. The catalog has no entry yet, and the page says so. A component appears there when its child card adds it.

The route exists in dev only. In production it does not exist.

## The tokens

All tokens live in `assets/styles/tokens.css`. `assets/styles/app.css` imports it. A token is a CSS custom property, and the comment above it is its use. A `@group` comment starts a group.

| Group | What it holds |
|---|---|
| colour | The raw colour values, and the Tailwind names for them |
| type | The font stacks. The Tailwind text sizes carry the scale |
| spacing | One step of the spacing scale. Every gap and size is a multiple of it |
| radius | The corner radii |
| shadow | The shadows of surfaces that float above the page |
| motion | The durations and the easing curves |

A new token appears on the styleguide with no other change.

## The stylesheets

1. `tokens.css` holds the tokens and nothing else.
2. `components/<name>.css` holds the styles of one building block. A child card adds each file with its component.
3. `app.css` imports both, and holds the rules of the features.

The widget and the email stylesheet cannot import `tokens.css`. They hold copies of the values they need, and a test keeps each copy equal to the token.
In `email.css`, each copied value names its token in a trailing comment, such as `/* --accent */`, and `EmailTokensMatchAppTest` compares the two.

## The rules

1. Write no arbitrary value. Use a token or a named Tailwind scale step. `NoArbitraryValuesCheck` enforces this in `just gamache`.
2. Snap an off-scale value to the nearest token. A change to a token is a change to the system.
3. Use a building block from the catalog. Write no raw markup for a block that the catalog lists.
